## ⇁  Note
This is a hobby project I do not intend to start anytime soon. Once I get into 3D printing and OpenSCAD then I might, but as of now I am a poor college student.

## ⇁  Welcome
This is a repo for all the project I intent to use in my attempt to create a better laptop for my friends and family. Based on the framework laptop with a Linux OS using cutefish as a desktop enviornment. I want them to use great substainable products with security, preformance and great UI/design in every aspect of this. We will see if this turns into something great down the road.
