## ⇁  Note
This is a hobby project I do not intend to start anytime soon. It is compriced of two parts, one create a better chasis for the framework laptop, two create a linux distribution. Both seem time intencive, I do not have a 3d printer and rn I need to focus on smaller projects.

## ⇁  Welcome
This is a repo for all the project I intent to use in my attempt to create a better laptop for my friends and family. Based on the framework laptop with a Linux OS using cutefish as a desktop enviornment. I want them to use great substainable products with security, preformance and great UI/design in every aspect of this. We will see if this turns into something great down the road.

## ⇁  Motivation
Honestly I think now is the time when we should focus on creating a linux for the average joe. Looking at projects such as the (SteamDeck)[https://www.steamdeck.com/en/], its operating system SteamOS, and (Framework)[frame.work] shows that there are considerable amounts of money being thrown into this sector. If there is such a thing as "The year of the Linux desktop" (I would prefer the year of Linux laptop. I think desktops are dead) then I think that is going to be soon if it will ever succeed. So I want to help promote this for purely ideological reasons and in the end, isn't an ideological goal how startups start?
